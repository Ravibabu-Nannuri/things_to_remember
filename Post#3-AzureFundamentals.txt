Azure Fundamentals(Cont.): Basic Things to remember

	1) Commonly used tools for day to day Azure management and interaction are:  Azure Portal, Azure PowerShell, Azure CLI, Azure Cloud Shell, Azure SDKs
	2) Positive of Azure CLI is it works exactly the same way on any platform (Like Mac, Linux and Windows)
	3) Before using Azure CLI, get yourself familiarized with Azure portal first to understand different Azure services and the options they provide.
	4) There are four ways to get the computing resources from Azure. VM's, Containers, App Service and Serverless Computing
	5) VM's include guest operating system where as Containers doesn't include the operating system for the apps running inside container.
	6) Containers are often used in applications that use microservices architecture
	7) Containerize all your services (Preferably Docker Containers )
	8) Publish the container images to Azure Container Registry (ACR) or to other repositories like Jfrog Artificatory
	9) To deploy Kubernetes cluster, use the azure managed Kubernetes Service (AKS)
	10) Azure app service is a PaaS offering for enterprise-grade web oriented applications
	11) Using Azure AppService, we can host webapps, API Apps, WebJobs and Mobile Apps
	12) Serverless computing is a cloud-hosted execution environment that runs your code but completely abstracts the underlying hosting environment
    Serverless computing encompasses three ideas: abstraction of execution environment, an event driven scale, pay only for the time your code runs.
